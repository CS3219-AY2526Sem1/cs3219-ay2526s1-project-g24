  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Matching service for pairing users based on difficulty, topics, and programming languages.

    ## Features
    - Creates match requests that persist until matched or cancelled
    - Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    - Automatic matching based on compatibility criteria
    - Auto-cancellation when SSE connection is closed (user disconnects)
    - Observable with Prometheus metrics

    ## Matching Criteria
    Users are compatible if:
    - Same difficulty level
    - At least one overlapping topic
    - At least one overlapping programming language

    ## Important Behavior
    - **Configurable timeout**: Requests timeout after `MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default: 30s) if not matched
    - **Timeout implementation**: Uses Redis sorted set with periodic scanning for accurate, reliable timeout detection
    - **Auto-cancel on disconnect**: Closing the SSE connection cancels the request
    - **Active connection required**: Users must maintain SSE connection to stay in queue
    
  ## Timeout Mechanism
  The service uses a Redis sorted set with **atomic popping** for timeouts:
  - Requests tracked with deadline timestamps in a single `match:timeouts` sorted set
  - Timeout worker pops expired items in one atomic operation every ~5 seconds to avoid duplicate handling
  - Provides accurate timeout metrics without relying on keyspace notifications
  - Works consistently across managed Redis deployments and replicas

      summary: Create a new match request
      description: |
        Creates a new match request and begins searching for a compatible partner.
        The request will remain in queue until matched or until the SSE connection is closed.

        **Important:** You must open an SSE connection at `/v1/match/requests/{reqId}/events` 
        and keep it open. Closing the SSE connection will automatically cancel the match request.

        Use Server-Sent Events at `/v1/match/requests/{reqId}/events` to receive real-time updates.

      summary: Subscribe to real-time match updates (SSE)
      description: |
        Server-Sent Events stream providing real-time updates for a match request.

        **Critical:** Keeping this SSE connection open is required to stay in the matching queue.
        When the connection is closed (e.g., user closes tab), the match request is automatically cancelled.

        ## Event Format
        Events are sent as JSON in the `data` field with the following structure:
        - `status`: Current request status ("queued", "matched", "cancelled")
        - `timestamp`: Event timestamp in milliseconds
        - `elapsed`: Seconds elapsed since request creation (for queued status)
        - `sessionId`: Collaboration session ID (only when matched)

        ## Usage Example
        ```javascript
        const eventSource = new EventSource(`/v1/match/requests/${reqId}/events`);

        eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
          const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
          
          if (data.status === 'queued') {
            console.log(`Waiting... ${data.elapsed}s`);
          } else if (data.status === 'matched') {
            console.log('Matched! Session:', data.sessionId);
            window.location.href = `/session/${data.sessionId}`;
          } else if (data.status === 'cancelled') {
            console.log('Request cancelled');
          }
        };

        // Closing this connection cancels the request
        // eventSource.close();
        ```
